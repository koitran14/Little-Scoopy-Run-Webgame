1. Window: requestAnimationFrame() method

The window.requestAnimationFrame() method tells the browser you wish to perform an animation. 
It requests the browser to call a user-supplied callback function before the next repaint.

The frequency of calls to the callback function will generally match the display refresh rate. 
The most common refresh rate is 60hz, (60 cycles/frames per second), though 75hz, 120hz, and 144hz 
are also widely used. requestAnimationFrame() calls are paused in most browsers when running in background 
tabs or hidden <iframe>s, in order to improve performance and battery life.

2. HTMLCanvasElement: getContext() method
The HTMLCanvasElement.getContext() method returns a drawing context on the canvas, or null 
if the context identifier is not supported, or the canvas has already been set to a different context mode.

Later calls to this method on the same canvas element, with the same contextType argument, will always return
the same drawing context instance as was returned the first time the method was invoked. It is not possible to 
get a different drawing context object on a given canvas element.

3. JavaScript automatically creates references to all elements with IDS into the global namespace, using it's ID as a variable name
